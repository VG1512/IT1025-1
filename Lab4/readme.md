## Executive Summary 
Python is a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python's simple and easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of maintaining the program. Python supports modules and packages, which contributes to program modularity and code reuse.

## Code Examples
### Variable:
A variable is like a box in the computer’s memory where you can store a single value. If you want to use the result of an evaluated expression later in your program, you can save it inside a variable. 
A variable is initialized (or created) the first time a value is stored in it. After that, you can use it in expressions with other variables and values 
### Assignment statement:
You’ll store values in variables with an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement spam = 42, then a variable named spam will have the integer value 42 stored in it.
### Function:
The print() function displays the string value inside the parentheses on the screen.
print('Hello world!')
   print('What is your name?') # ask for their name
When writing a function name, the opening and closing parentheses at the end identify it as the name of a function.
   
### Three data types:
The Integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero.
Floating-Point numbers are numbers that have fractional parts (usually expressed with a decimal point).
String Data Types is a data type used in programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Vector graphics is a digital art that is created by a computer using a mathematical formula. Bitmaps consist of pixels or tiny dots that use color and tone to create an image.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

Compression can be lossy or lossless . Lossless compression means that as the file size is compressed, the picture quality remains the same - it does not get worse. Also, the file can be decompressed to its original quality. Lossy compression permanently removes data.

### File Formats
JPEG format for all images containing a natural scene or photo. PNG format for any image that requires transparency, or for images with text for example and logos objects. GIF format for images containing animation.
### File Properties
The General tab of the Properties dialog box will provide you with information such as the full path to the file or folder, its size, what application is configured to open it, and the date it was created, last modified, and accessed.

## Conclusion


The General tab of the Properties dialog box will provide you with information such as the full path to the file or folder, its size, what application is configured to open it, and the date it was created, last modified, and accessed.
