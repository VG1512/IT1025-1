## Executive Summary 
In week #6 we are going to know about HTML. It is the most basic building block of the Web. We can read and understand the differences between IPv4 and IPv6. The main part of this week will be our practice using HTML constructor.

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
IPv4 is a 32-bit IP address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit IP address.
IPv4 is a numeric addressing method, whereas IPv6 is an alphanumeric addressing method.
IPv4 binary bits are separated by a dot (.) whereas a colon separates IPv6 binary bits (:).
IPv4 offers 12 header fields whereas IPv6 offers 8 header fields.
IPv4 supports broadcast, whereas IPv6 does not support broadcast.
IPv4 has checksum fields, and IPv6 has no checksum fields
When we compare IPv4 and IPv6, IPv4 supports VLSM (variable length subnet mask) whereas IPv6 does not support VLSM.
IPv4 uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map to a MAC address, whereas IPv6 uses UDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) to map to a MAC address.

#### IP Address
#### ICANN
To communicate with another user over the Internet, you must enter the appropriate address in the computer: name or number. This address must be unique so that computers can find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers around the world. Without this, there would be no global Internet.

ICANN plays an administrative role with respect to the IP addresses that computers use, as well as with respect to domain names that people use.
The role of ICANN is to oversee a large and complex unified network of unique identifiers that allow computers on the Internet to find each other.


### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
The TCP/IP protocol is an entire network model that describes the way data is transmitted digitally. The rules included in it are the basis for the operation of the Internet and local networks, regardless of their purpose and structure.
The set of rules included in it allows processing both end-to-end data transmission and other details of this mechanism. This includes the formation of packets, the way they are sent, received, routed, unpacked for transmission to the software.

#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
TCP/IP connections work similarly to a phone call, when someone has to initiate a connection by dialing a phone number. At the other end of the connection, someone has to listen for calls and then pick up the line when a call arrives. In TCP/IP communication, the IP address is similar to the phone number, and the port number is similar to the port number. a specific extension number after answering the call. A "client" in a TCP/IP connection is a computer or device that "dials a phone number", and a "server" is a computer that "listens" to incoming calls. In other words, the Client needs to know the IP address of any server he wants to connect to, and he also needs to know the port number through which he wants to send and receive data after the connection has been established.
#### Layers

#### Application Layer
HTTP, CoAP, EBHTTP, LTP, SNMP, IPfix, DNS, NTP, SSH, DLMS, COSEM, DNP, MODBUS.

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
SSL (Secure Socket Layer - Secure Sockets Protocol) / TLS (Transport Layer Security - transport layer security)
When using these security protocols, data is encrypted in order to prevent a threat to their security.
Web Server (HTTPS)	
The Internet protocol HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - Hypertext transfer Protocol) uses SSL.
IPPS
IPP (Internet Printing Protocol - Internet Printing Protocol) version 1.0 uses SSL.
SNMPv3
The SNMPv3 protocol (Simple Network Management Protocol), version 3 provides user authentication and data encryption for secure management of network devices.


## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
The lack of protection of your web browser can quickly lead to a lot of computer problems caused by anything from spyware installed without your knowledge to hackers taking over your computer.
### Risk Explained
Cookies are files placed on your system to store data for certain websites. A cookie may contain any information that the website is intended to place in it. Cookies may contain information about the sites you have visited or may even contain credentials to access the site. Cookies are intended to be read only by the website that created them. Session cookies are deleted when the browser is closed, and persistent cookies will remain on the computer until the specified expiration date is reached.
Cookies can be used to uniquely identify website visitors, which some people consider a violation of privacy. If a website uses cookies for authentication, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to this site by obtaining a cookie. Persistent cookies pose a higher risk than session cookies because they stay on the computer longer.
The issue of using cookies is gradually becoming not only a matter for marketers and technical specialists, but also lawyers.

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open source Solid platform. Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web has to work. Solid technically is is new level of standard at the web layer, which adds things never put into the original spec, such as global single sign-on, universal access control, and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any storage place. Socially Solid is a movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which users are in control, and empowered by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.
The purpose of the semantic web is to make Internet data machine - readable . To enable encoding of semantics with data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used for the formal presentation of metadata.
The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across applications, businesses, and communities. This is a joint work led by the W3C with the participation of a large number of researchers and industrial partners.
The biggest advantage of the semantic web is that it abstracts tedious documents and the application layer to have direct access to knowledge.

### HTML5 and CSS
HTML provides the basic structure of websites, which is improved and modified by other technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout.
### HTML and XML
The difference between XML and HTML
They are designed to solve different tasks: XML solves the problem of storing and transporting data, focusing on what this data is, HTML solves the problem of displaying data, focusing on how this data looks.

## Components of a URL
Scheme, Domain name, File path, Parameters, Anchor.
## Conclusion
This week we tried to use HTML. It was so interesting to see how your code looks on the webpage. How we can change text, size, and color letters. We can insert pictures and links. We understand from which parts consist of the URL of pages. Now I know how I can secure my web browser because I  can use security protocols.
