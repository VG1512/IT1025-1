## Executive Summary 
In this module we will explore and practice with file and folder compression. Explore object oriented programming or OOP and practice creating a class and objects using Python and explore Object Oriented Programming Concepts and how it can be used to define classes.

## File Compression
1. Quantity folders equal 1. 
2. Easy and fast sending and downloading folder. 
3. Don’t need extra software.

### Purpose of File Compression
File compression is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or the Internet.

### Compression and File Size
Before compression the size of the file SVG was 16,9 KB and after compression it is 9,30 KB. If I am emailing a zip file to someone or posting it to the Web, it takes less time to upload—and your recipients will also be able to download it more quickly.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
Class attributes are attributes that belong to the class itself. They will be shared by all instances of the class. Therefore, they have the same value for each instance. We define class attributes outside of all methods, usually they are placed at the top, right under the class header.

### Methods:
According to the Python data model, the language offers three types of methods: static, class, and class instance.
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class.
The argument to these functions is the word self, which is a reference to objects that are made based on this class. To reference instances (or objects) of the class, self will always be the first parameter, but it need not be the only one.
Defining this class did not create any Shark objects
In our example we use 2 methods are swim() sand be awesome().

### Constructor:
A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in your class. The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. Also known as the __init__ method. The constructor method is automatically initialized. 

### Class vs. Object
A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. ... While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. Creating an instance of a class means the same thing as "creating an object". When you create an object, you are creating an "instance" of the class, hence "instantiating" the class.

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
Creating an instance means creating such an instance, for example, by defining one specific variant of an object in a class, naming it and placing it in some physical location.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is when a class uses code constructed within another class. If we think of inheritance in terms of biology, we can think of a child inheriting certain traits from their parent. That is, a child can inherit a parent’s height or eye color. Children also may share the same last name with their parents.
We can think of a parent class called Parent that has class variables for last_name, height, and eye_color that the child class Child will inherit from the Parent.
Classes called child classes or subclasses inherit methods and variables from parent classes or base classes.

### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Abstraction is a method of hiding unwanted information . While encapsulation is a method of hiding data in a single object or unit together with a method of protecting information from the outside.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
Graphical description language for object modeling in the field of software development, for modeling business processes, system design and displaying organizational structures.

## Conclusion
On this week we went through creating classes, instantiating objects, initializing attributes with the constructor method, and working with more than one object of the same class.
