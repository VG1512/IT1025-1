## Executive Summary 
I can highlight the main points in this chapter. It is module Python and Careers in Computing. It was the most interesting and productive information for me. Phyton is the first computer language that I start to learn. I have a lot of training modules for it. I am ready to take all modules for practice and understanding how it works.

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Easy backup; Consolidation of server hardware; Common platform for servers
### Role of Hypervisor
We can met Hypervisor in Data virtualization, Desktop virtualization, Server Virtualization, Operating system visualization, and Network functions virtualization.
Hypervisors support creation and management of virtual machines by abstracting a computer’s software from its hardware. Hypervisors make virtualization possible by translating requests between the physical and virtual resources.


## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Python pseudocode is more like an algorithmic representation of the code involved. This means when a code is expected to be formulated it cannot be directly drafted. The code will need to be first generated into a Python pseudocode and then it needs to be formulated into an actual code. This process of formulating an English sentence-like algorithmic representation is what a Python pseudocode means to be. In simple terms, the Python pseudocode is a syntax-free representation of code.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters. An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. 
Advantages of interpreted languages
Interpreted languages tend to be more flexible, and often offer features like dynamic typing and smaller program size. Also, because interpreters execute the source program code themselves, the code itself is platform independent.
Disadvantages of interpreted languages
The most notable disadvantage is typical execution speed compared to compiled languages.

### Bureau of Labor Statistics
When I did my research on https://www.bls.gov/ooh/occupation-finder.htm I saw that level of your education play in this question's main role. When I looked into the duties which I should do in the future I understand that I did the right choice.
### Certifications
All those certificates CompTIA, Cisco, CISSP helps us to be stronger in our knowledge. It is about question when we think about good service for our clients. Of course, you should clearly understand which certificate do you need for your job.  
### Certificates and Degrees
I choose the Data Analytics - Post-Degree Professional Certificate. I am so glad because I can get it at the Cuyahoga Community College. IT is a good opportunity for everybody who wants it but couldn't have a lot of money. 
### Co-ops / Internships
Experiential Learning is a great chance to try yourself in what you choose. It shows you what you should do to be a good specialist in your area. And sometimes it can show you maybe you did the wrong choice and you can change your direction for other occupations
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
I chose those 2 groups: CCDC and IEEE. I am surprised which high education level you can offer for your students. Missions are those groups are directed to give strong and actual knowledge. It also gives you support on your studying and working way. You also can find like-minded people in that.

## Conclusion
I am so glad to have the opportunity to learn more and more about what I like about this course. When I saw all those videos it is like a lecture from famous experts in this area and it is so valued. All materials collected at this course are gorgeous. Every new study unit I wait with a great deal.
