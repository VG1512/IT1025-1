### Executive Summary
Python is a programming language. Future for Python.
What is Python and why is it so popular.
Python is an actively developing scripting language that is used to solve a large volume of the most diverse problems and tasks.
Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. It can be used in various fields: for the development of web and mobile applications, data processing, writing system scripts, etc.
Python was created in the late 80s by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum. Since then, it has been updated regularly, new features have appeared, but the basic philosophy has remained unchanged. This programming language has a clean syntax and well-structured code that is easy to read. "Beautiful is better than ugly," "Simple is better than complex," and "Readability matters," says Zen of Python, a collection of basic principles for writing code.
According to the RedMonks ratings for June 2020, Python is the second most popular programming language in the world. There are many reasons for this. We will consider the most important ones.
Python is easy to learn and easy to work with.
This language is very convenient for beginners. The syntax of the code is clean and simple. It uses keywords from the English language. Compared to other programming languages Python requires fewer lines of code to perform the same tasks. Its code is written faster and is easily understood even by novice developers.
Hundreds of libraries and frameworks.
One of the main reasons for Python's popularity is its rich ecosystem. You can choose from a variety of libraries and frameworks to simplify and speed up the process of writing code. Frameworks such as Django and Flask are used in web development. Pandas, SciPy, NumPy and Matplotlib are the most popular libraries among data analysts. In addition, there are libraries and frameworks for mobile application development, machine learning, HTML parsing and many other things.
Python is flexible and versatile.
It is a powerful tool that is widely used in various fields.
For example:
1. WEB Development
2. Automated Testing and Artificial Intelligence
3. Machine Learning
4. Mibile Application Development
5. Imageprocessing and Computer Vision
6. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
7. Data science: Data Aalysis and Visualization
8. Game Development

Of course, this list is not complete, but it shows a wide range of projects in which you can apply the skill of programming in Python.
Companies that use Python
To give you a more complete picture of the real capabilities of Python developers, let's look at which companies use this programming language in their projects.
* Google has been using Python almost from the beginning. Currently Python is one of their official server languages along with C++, Java and Go.
* Facebook has also included Python in its technology stack.
* Instagram uses Python in its server application. In 2016, the company's engineering team announced that they were launching the world's largest deployment of the Django web framework, written entirely in Python.
* Spotify and Netflix use Python primarily for data analysis and server processes.
* Dropbox is another well-known company that uses Python.
There are many more impressive names: Reddit, Amazon, Uber, NASA, Stripe and others. As you can see, Python is actively used by many giants in the world of technology, as well as thousands of small companies.
The demand for qualified specialists is growing every year. According to Glassdoor, in December 2020, there were 72704 vacancies in the United States, one way or another related to Python: from automated testing engineers and junior software developers to machine learning and artificial intelligence engineers.
• According to a study by Redmonk, following the results of the 1st quarter of 2021, Python is the second most popular programming language, ahead of Java.
• According to the Stack Overflow study, Python ranks first as the Most Wanted language by the end of 2020 (a language that experts do not know, but want to learn first).
* In the JetBrains study by the end of 2020, it is possible to study in detail the prevalence of the language's fields of application: first of all, it is data analytics and Data Science (Python is the first language there now), it is also very popular among web developers (Django and Flask frameworks), well, in fact, it is actively used in almost all areas, from testing to game development.
### Conclusion
The Python programming language turned 30 years old this year. Since 2000, it has been among the 10 most popular languages. At the moment, he ranks first in a number of popularity ratings. The history of other popular languages shows that even in the worst-case scenario of a rapid loss of popularity, this is a process for years, if not decades. According to the TIOBE index, C++ and Java languages, despite the fact that they have been losing popularity for the last 20 years, still remain in the top five. Based on this, we can say that Python programming definitely has a future.
